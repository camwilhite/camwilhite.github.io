How does the brain weave together action and thought?

I'm a graduate student in the Scanziani lab at UCSF, where I study how the midbrain superior colliculus (SC) helps coordinate spatial movement. I'm particularly interested in how the SC encodes orienting movements during navigation and how its activity is shaped by ongoing cognitive representations of spatial possibilities. My research combines animal behavior, neural recordings, and computational analysis.

Before UCSF, I earned my master's degree at the University of Arizona, where I helped develop new techniques for mapping electrical activity in the brain and heart.

More broadly, I'm interested in how brains and artificial systems generate, organize, and act upon their own internal models of the world.
