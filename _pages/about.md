Moving and thinking are deeply intertwined. What does this relationship look like in the brain?

I'm a neuroscience PhD student working with <a href="https://scanzianilab.ucsf.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Massimo Scanziani</a> and <a href="https://franklab.ucsf.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Loren Frank</a>, where I study how the brain tracks spatial movements during navigation and how this activity is shaped by mental simulations of possible paths. My research combines animal behavior, neural recordings, and computational analysis. Before UCSF, I earned my master's degree at the University of Arizona with <a href="https://psychology.arizona.edu/person/stephen-cowen" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stephen Cowen</a> and <a href="https://medicine.arizona.edu/person/russell-witte-phd" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Russell Witte</a>, where I helped develop new techniques for mapping electrical activity in the brain and heart.

More broadly, I'm interested in how brains and artificial systems generate, organize, and act upon their own internal models of the world.
