Movement and thought are deeply intertwined. What does this relationship look like in the brain?

I'm a neuroscience graduate student at UCSF working with Massimo Scanziani, where I study how the midbrain superior colliculus encodes spatial movements during navigation and how this activity is shaped by ongoing 'mental simulations' of possible future paths. My research combines animal behavior, neural recordings, and computational analysis.

Before UCSF, I earned my master's degree at the University of Arizona, where I helped develop new techniques for mapping electrical activity in the brain and heart.

More broadly, I'm interested in how brains and artificial systems generate, organize, and act upon their own internal models of the world.
