Abstract: Changes in movement direction, like left and right turns, are core elements of an animal’s behavior as it navigates through its environment. During locomotion, turns occur in precise coordination with the ongoing stepping rhythm and require internal planning for the animal’s potential future path. The superior colliculus (SC) is a conserved vertebrate midbrain structure involved in turning. Whether neuronal activity in the SC is coordinated with both locomotor dynamics and internal representations of future paths is unknown. Here we recorded from SC neurons as mice navigated a Y-maze while tracking ongoing locomotor dynamics and decoding internal representations of future paths from hippocampal place cells. Neurons in the intermediate and deep layers of the SC fired more as the animal turned in one or the other direction at the maze bifurcation (left or right “turn cells”). Interestingly, turn cell activity was tightly coupled to the ongoing left-right head-body rhythm associated with locomotion such that cells that were selective for opposite turn directions fired at opposite phases of the head-body rhythm. Turn cell activity was also modulated in coordination with hippocampal representations of potential future paths. For example, right turn cells fired more at the maze bifurcation following hippocampal representations of rightward paths compared to representations of leftward paths. Thus, during navigation, turn-selective activity in the SC is precisely coordinated with both locomotor dynamics and internal representations of future paths. This coordination may allow animals to seamlessly execute turns during locomotion while navigating toward planned destinations.
