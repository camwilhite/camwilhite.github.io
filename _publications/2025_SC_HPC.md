Working abstract: During navigation, turning movements are executed in precise coordination with the ongoing locomotor rhythm and require internal planning for the animal’s potential future path. The superior colliculus (SC) is a conserved vertebrate midbrain structure involved in the control of orienting movements. Whether the SC is coordinated with both rhythmic locomotor dynamics and internal representations of potential future paths is unknown. Here we recorded from SC neurons as mice navigated a Y-maze while tracking ongoing locomotor dynamics and decoding representations of future paths from hippocampal place cell activity. Neurons in the intermediate and deep layers of the SC fired more as the animal turned in one or the other direction at the maze bifurcation (left or right “turn cells”). Interestingly, turn cell activity was rhythmically coupled to the ongoing left-right head-body rhythm characteristic of locomotion such that cells that were selective for opposite turn directions fired at opposite phases of the head-body rhythm. Furthermore, the relative phase preference predicted the functional connectivity among rhythmically-firing cells, with excitation being prevalent between cells firing on similar phases and inhibition between cells firing on dissimilar phases of the locomotor rhythm. The activity of turn cells was also modulated in coordination with hippocampal representations of potential left or right future paths. For a given turn direction, SC cells fired most strongly during turns that were preceded by hippocampal representations of paths in their preferred direction. Our results reveal that, during navigation, turn-selective activity in the SC is precisely coordinated with both locomotor dynamics and internal representations of potential future paths. This coordination may allow animals to seamlessly execute turns during locomotion while planning for their future path through space.
