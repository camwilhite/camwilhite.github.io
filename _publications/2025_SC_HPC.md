Working abstract: Changes in movement direction, like left and right turns, are core elements of an animal’s behavior as it navigates through its environment. During locomotion, turns occur in precise coordination with the ongoing stepping rhythm and require internal planning for the animal’s potential future path. The superior colliculus (SC) is a conserved vertebrate midbrain structure involved in spatial orienting. Whether the SC is coordinated with both locomotor dynamics and internal representations of future paths is unknown. Here we recorded from SC neurons as mice navigated a Y-maze while tracking ongoing locomotor dynamics and decoding representations of future paths from the hippocampus. Neurons in the intermediate and deep layers of the SC fired more as the animal turned in one or the other direction at the maze bifurcation (left or right “turn cells”). Interestingly, turn cell activity was tightly coupled to the ongoing left-right head-body rhythm characteristic of locomotion such that cells that were selective for opposite turn directions fired at opposite phases of this rhythm. The activity of turn cells was also modulated in coordination with hippocampal representations of potential left or right future paths. For a given turn direction, SC cells fired more during turns that were preceded by hippocampal representations of paths in their preferred direction compared to their non-preferred direction. These data reveal that, during navigation, turn-selective activity in the SC is precisely coordinated with both locomotor dynamics and internal representations of future paths. This coordination may allow animals to seamlessly execute turns during locomotion while navigating toward planned destinations.
