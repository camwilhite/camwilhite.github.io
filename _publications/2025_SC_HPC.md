Working abstract: Orienting movements, like left and right turns, are core elements of an animal’s behavior as it navigates through its environment. How the superior colliculus (SC), a midbrain structure involved in stimulus-triggered orienting, encodes orienting movements during self-generated behaviors like navigation is not fully understood. Here we recorded from populations of SC cells as mice navigated a Y-maze. We discovered that neurons in the intermediate and deep layers of the SC not only fired more as the animal turned in one specific direction at the maze bifurcation (left or right “turn cells”) but, throughout the maze, their activity was rhythmically modulated by the ongoing left-right head-body oscillation characteristic of locomotion. Interestingly, cells with opposite turn direction selectivity fired at opposite phases of the head-body oscillation. Finally, we found that the activity of turn cells was modulated by hippocampal representations of spatial trajectories that sweep ahead of the animal towards possible left or right future paths. For a given turn direction, turn cells fired more during trials with hippocampal sweeps in their preferred turn direction compared to trials with sweeps in their non-preferred turn direction. Together, these results demonstrate that the SC encodes self-generated turns during navigation in a manner that is tightly coupled to the locomotor head-body oscillation and modulated by hippocampal representations of possible future paths. Thus, the SC orienting system is engaged during both overt and covert orienting dynamics.
