Working abstract: The ability to represent possible futures enables animals to evaluate different options based on their expected outcomes, and to act based on those evaluations. The hippocampus can express representations corresponding to possible future paths, but how these representations are transformed into actions is unknown. The superior colliculus (SC) is a conserved vertebrate midbrain structure involved in orienting behavior, like turning left or right. Whether hippocampal and SC activity patterns are coordinated is unknown. We therefore recorded from hippocampal and putative motor neurons in the intermediate and deep layers of the SC (dSC) as mice navigated a Y-maze. The activity of a set of dSC neurons depended on the turn direction at the maze bifurcation (left or right preferring ‘turn cells’). Hippocampal representations of future left or right paths predicted increased firing rates of turn cells with concordant left or right turn preference. These results reveal a coordination between a cognitive and a motor structure and provide a potential pathway for representations of possible futures to influence actions.
