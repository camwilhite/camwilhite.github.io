Working abstract: Vision is fundamental to how animals navigate their environment, yet the neural pathways that convey visual inputs to the spatial navigation system remain poorly understood. Lateral higher visual cortical areas (LHVAs) are situated at the crossroads between the superior colliculus, from which they receive visual information via the tecto-pulvinar pathway, and the hippocampus, where spatial information is represented in maps of place fields. To determine the impact of the tecto-pulvinar-LHVA pathway on these hippocampal representations of space, we trained animals to traverse a linear track with reward locations at each end and alternated blocks of trials under ambient illumination with blocks in near-total darkness (<100 R*/rod/s). Following training, recordings from CA1 during trials in ambient light revealed stable place fields that tiled the track, as expected. Interestingly, shifting to near-total darkness led to a drastic spatial rearrangement of place fields, yielding a new yet stable sequence tiling the track. The original arrangement of place fields was reinstated upon returning to light, after which the rearranged map could be retrieved by returning to darkness. The targeted surgical ablation of LHVAs abolished this rearrangement; that is, the maps in light became identical to the maps in darkness. Chronically silencing the tecto-pulvinar pathway with the conditional expression of tetanus toxin light chain produced a nearly identical effect. In contrast, surgical ablation of the primary visual cortex had little effect on rearrangements of light and dark maps. Thus, LHVAs and the tecto-pulvinar pathway are essential for dynamically updating CA1 spatial representations based on visual input.
