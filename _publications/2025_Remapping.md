Working abstract: Most mammals rely on vision to establish their position in space. The hippocampus is a brain structure whose neural activity represents a map of the animal’s position in space and, accordingly, this map is influenced by the visual environment. The pathways that convey visual signals to the hippocampus, however, remain poorly understood. At the output of the retina, visual information separates into two image-forming streams: one, prominent in mammals, targets the primary visual cortex (V1) and the other, conserved across vertebrates, targets the superior colliculus (SC). In rodents, both streams converge onto the lateral visual cortex (LVC). To determine the contribution of these visual pathways to hippocampal maps, we trained mice to traverse a linear track and alternated blocks of trials in light with blocks in darkness. Recordings from the hippocampus revealed two distinct maps of the track, one in light and one in dark. Training animals in which V1 had been lesioned did not affect the remapping between light and dark, indicating that visual signals still reached the hippocampus. In contrast, in mice with lesioned LVC, remapping between light and dark was greatly reduced, indicating that the visual input to the hippocampus was disrupted. Selectively blocking widefield cells, a SC neuronal population that is uniquely sensitive to visual motion and gives rise to the main SC output towards LVC, also reduced remapping. Thus, the SC contributes visual information to the hippocampal representation of space through a motion-sensitive pathway.  This pathway may account for the residual capability for vision-based navigation observed in humans with lesions to the primary visual cortex.
